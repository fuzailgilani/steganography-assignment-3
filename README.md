# Steganography Assignment 3 #

## Part 1: Calculate entropy of a file. ##

Completed functionality. To compile code, run the following command in the directory that contains the .c file:
`gcc -o entropy assignment3part1.c -lm`

To calculate the entropy of a file after compiling, use the following command:
`./entropy [FILE_NAME]`
where the `[FILE_NAME]` is the name of the file you want to calculate the entropy of.

The `-lm` flag is to link the mathematics library from C. This is required to use the math.h file in C.

## Part 2: Hide a message in a text file, using LSB steganography. ##

TODO: Begin part 2.
